# julien-f-source-map-support [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/julien-f/js-source-map-support-2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/julien-f/js-source-map-support-2)

> Source maps for Node (using stack-chain)

Differences with [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support):

- support only Node (no browsers)
- simpler:
    - do not handle uncaught exceptions
    - cannot specify a custom resolution
- based on [stack-chain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stack-chain)

> Note: the name of this package is temporary, maybe it will be
> renamed to something better or it will be integrated with
> [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support).
